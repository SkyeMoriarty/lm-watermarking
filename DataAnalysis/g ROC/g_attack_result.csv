MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the ""forgotten floor."" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually ""avoidable felonies."" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were",21.3%,-1.19

The explosion occurred at 5 p.m. about 20 meters (65 feet) from a mosque in Batna, a town about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of Algiers, security officials in Batna told the state-run news agency. The bomb went off 15 minutes before the expected arrival of President Abdel-Aziz Bouteflika. It wasn't clear if the bomb was caused by a suicide bomber or if it was planted, the officials said. Later Thursday, Algeria's Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni said ""a suspect person who was among the crowd attempted to go beyond the security cordon,"" but the person escaped ""immediately after the bomb exploded,"" the press service reported. Bouteflika made his visit to Batna as planned, adding a stop at a hospital to visit the wounded before he returned to the capital. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing.

 Researchers found virus called destructor in bees",39.8%,4.59," -- up to 90 percent of colonies in some U.S. beekeeping operations -- imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination, such as oranges, blueberries, apples and almonds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $15 billion worth of crops each year in the United States. More than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination. Signs of colony collapse disorder were first reported in the United States in 2004, the same year American beekeepers started importing bees from Australia. The disorder is marked by hives left with a queen, a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food, but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone. The virus identified in the healthy Australian bees is  Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) -- named that because it was discovered by Hebrew University researchers.

 virus found in honey bees may be playing role in collapse of honey bee colonies across United States , researchers reported Thursday . 

 "" Our results offer clues as to whether disease is being transmitted to honey bee species why this may be happening , "" said study coauthor John Andrulis , entomologist at University of Melbourne in Australia . 

 "" virus is introduced by number of bees , "" Andrulis said . "" We believe this means that if bee has virus is exposed to it during its lifetime , it acquires resistance to infection . "" 

 Researchers found virus called destructor in bees",33.1%,2.4," -- up to 90 percent of colonies in some U.S. beekeeping operations -- imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination, such as oranges, blueberries, apples and almonds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $15 billion worth of crops each year in the United States. More than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination. Signs of colony collapse disorder were first reported in the United States in 2004, the same year American beekeepers started importing bees from Australia. The disorder is marked by hives left with a queen, a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food, but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone. The virus identified in the healthy Australian bees is  Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) -- named that because it was discovered by Hebrew University researchers. Although worker bees in colony collapse disorder vanish, bees infected with IAPV die close to the hive, after developing shivering",27.4%,0.782

Prince William and Prince Harry arrive at a memorial service at Kensington Palace for Princess Diana

As children we were both loved hugely and adored by a large family.

There were many special occasions when we would go to our respective parents' houses and, for hours, we would sit and chat. We would all have something to eat and, most importantly, we could tell each other everything. We shared our secrets and shared our joys.

As a family, we had such strength and support from one another. I remember the many years of family vacations we would have with my mother and with my cousins. In them we would all find something to love and something to share.

There were many happy times together. We learned so much from one another - the value of friendship, of family unity, of mutual respect and of what it is to be a family.

She never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated. She will always be remembered for her amazing public work. But behind the media glare, to us, just two loving children, she was quite simply the best mother in the world. We would say that, wouldn't we. But we miss her. She kissed us last thing at night.
