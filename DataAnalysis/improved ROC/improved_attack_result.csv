m-nom,0.1,4.0,"(CNN) -- A virus found in healthy Australian honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across the United States, researchers reported Thursday. Honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the Bee Research Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees"," in the United States in recent years.

In a new study, researchers used blood samples from healthy bees to assess whether viruses and other pathogens could be playing a role in the decline in bee colonies.

They found that the number of viruses detected in healthy bees was significantly higher than in those infected with a lethal strain of the disease. The higher infection rate could mean a higher probability of transmission in colonies, the researchers said.

The findings suggest that viruses and pathogens could play a role in the decline in bee colonies, said senior author Dr. Paul Spaulding, a professor of entomology at Ohio State University.

m-nom,0.7,4.0,"(CNN) -- A virus found in healthy Australian honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across the United States, researchers reported Thursday. Honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the Bee Research Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees"," in the United States in recent years.

In a new study, researchers used blood samples from healthy bees to assess whether viruses and other pathogens could be playing a role in the decline in bee colonies.

They found that the number of viruses detected in healthy bees was significantly higher than in those infected with a lethal strain of the disease. The higher infection rate could mean a higher probability of transmission in colonies, the researchers said.

The findings suggest that viruses and pathogens could play a role in the decline in bee colonies, said senior author Dr. Paul Spaulding, a professor of entomology at Ohio State University.

""We found a higher number of viruses in colonies that were infected with lethal viruses, so that would suggest there was more of an opportunity for the virus to get in and transmit to the colony,"" Spaulding said in a video news conference Thursday. ""So we need to be watching closely.""

Congressional Democrats have begun to voice their objections to a House resolution calling Turkey's actions against Armenians in the final years of the First World War ""genocide.""

A recent Washington Post/ABC poll found that 49% of Americans said the genocide should be called a crime against humanity, and 33% said it shouldn't be compared to the Holocaust.

Some Democrats have privately expressed concern over the wording of the proposed House resolution, a move that would be a political challenge for the party as it looks to retain hold of its majority.

For months, Democrats have been reluctant to endorse the resolution because of concerns that it would cast Turkey in a negative light, while failing to acknowledge the suffering of Armenians and other minorities in the Ottoman Empire.
