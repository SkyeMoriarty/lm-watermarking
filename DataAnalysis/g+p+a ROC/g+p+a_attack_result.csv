The base, in southern Turkey near Syria, is a major resupply center for U.S. operations in Iraq and elsewhere in the Mideast and Asia. The Pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in Iraq if Turkey cuts off U.S. access to the strategically important Incirlik, military officials said Tuesday. Ankara acknowledges the killings of Armenians during World War I but vehemently objects to the ""genocide"" label. The House Foreign Affairs Committee last week adopted the nonbinding resolution.

m-nom,0.1,"MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN) -- An enraged crowd dragged the body of an Ethiopian soldier through the streets of Somalia's capital Thursday after gun battles with Islamic insurgents killed 19 people, witnesses reported. In a brutal echo of a 1993 battle involving Somali militias in which the bodies of U.S. troops"," were found in the streets, the Somali army soldiers were then dragged and beaten to death.

""We want the soldiers to be punished,"" one witness, Abdel Aziz Omar, told CNN by phone. ""They are soldiers who fought against the Somali people.""

An unidentified soldier fired shots in the air, and the mob dragged the bodies of seven Ethiopian soldiers, along with other wounded soldiers and soldiers who were civilians, through the streets, witnesses said. A senior Somali security official denied Omar's account, saying he did not know about such a massacre. And a spokesman for the Somali Ministry of Defense denied the body of a soldier had been dragged through Mogadishu's streets.

""We have no such incident. No, I don't know about it,"" Abdiaziz Abdullahi said.

But a high-ranking Ethiopian source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the troops had been killed. He said they were killed during a gun battle in which a group of Somali",56.9%,10.3,"found in the streets,  were soldiers and Somali army soldiers were then  andd andragged and  soldiers and civilian to death.
