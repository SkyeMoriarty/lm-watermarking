MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the ""forgotten floor."" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually ""avoidable felonies."" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman.

The explosion occurred at 5 p.m. about 20 meters (65 feet) from a mosque in Batna, a town about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of Algiers, security officials in Batna told the state-run news agency. The bomb went off 15 minutes before the expected arrival of President Abdel-Aziz Bouteflika. It wasn't clear if the bomb was caused by a suicide bomber or if it was planted, the officials said. Later Thursday, Algeria's Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni said ""a suspect person who was among the crowd attempted to go beyond the security cordon,"" but the person escaped ""immediately after the bomb exploded,"" the press service reported. Bouteflika made his visit to Batna as planned, adding a stop at a hospital to visit the wounded before he returned to the capital. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing.

The virus, which the researchers said they had named AVR-2, first showed up in American honey bees collected in Canada in 2003 and hasn't been spotted in other hives of the insects since then. It has since spread across the Pacific and into Africa, where it's also infecting honey bees.

Researchers in Britain found a strain of the virus spreading across a colony of Africanized honey bees in 2004.

""In the current epidemic we've found a new strain,"" said British entomologist Colin Campbell, the study lead author. ""It's very similar to the one we've seen in Canada and Australia. These strains are very similar to AVR-1 and it might be a combination of two or more.""

m-nom,0.5,"ABECHE, Chad (CNN) -- Most of the 103 children that a French charity attempted to take to France from Chad for adoption are neither Sudanese nor orphans, three international aid agencies reported on Thursday. Hundreds of women protest child trafficking and shout anti-French slogans Wednesday in Abeche, Chad. Six"," weeks of violence in Africa's Sahel region have fueled outrage against French involvement in Operation Barkhane (search), sending thousands of refugees across the border to Niger. Many more are expected to follow as fighting in southern Chad ramps up. The French government has said its troops are not involved in the regional fighting. French aid agencies, including France's Bien Aime (search), released a statement saying they will not collect the 103 children from their shelters. Human Rights Watch said there is ""serious evidence"" that the children in Abeche and elsewhere are victims of human trafficking. The charities said the children were not orphans.

Congress should cut spending ""and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law,"" President Bush"," said at an event in Indiana, about a month after saying he wanted to reach ""fiscal compromise."" Bush had planned to make a two-day, seven-city tour of battleground states in order to promote his $800 billion tax-cut package. But the trip, due to begin on Thursday in New York, was cut short with Bush saying he would have to return home because of the veto threat. White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush would ""probably not be making a second trip to the battleground states."" ""The president feels strongly about the need for a balanced approach to solving our economic problems and for balancing our budget,"" McClellan said in a statement. The White House believes the president has enough support in both houses to override the veto, he said. The House and Senate have a few weeks left to pass the measure before August recess.
