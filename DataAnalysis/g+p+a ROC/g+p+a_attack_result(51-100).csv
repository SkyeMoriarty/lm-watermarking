m-nom,0.5,"(InStyle.com) -- A hit TV show. An Emmy. A summer blockbuster. A new company. A wedding! Katherine Heigl has every reason to smile for our camera. A star -- and a trio of gorgeous looks -- is born. The Ingénue: ""This is my favorite look of"," the night,"" says Heigl, who is wearing a black, Christian Dior dress and a pair of black heels, while sporting a long, black train. ""I love my hair, it's all natural.""
""I like to think I'm a country girl. That's my background,"" she adds of her style choice. ""I have so much pride in my hair, it's a huge part of my identity.""
As for what she's planning for the wedding, ""I'm not going to be married to anyone. I'm single,"" Heigl says. ""I have no plans.""
While Heigl is still single, she says that she will be keeping an eye out for the next man she's going to share her life with, especially after her marriage in 2004 to Nick Lachey, the lead singer of boy band N*Sync.

As Katherine Heigl crosses the parking lot of the sandwich shop at the Roosevelt Golf Course at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, she walks stiffly, holding her arms away from her like a paper doll and apologizing profusely for running 10 minutes late. Earlier, she'd sprayed her entire body with self-tanner, which refused to dry. She resorted to having her fiancé, musician Josh Kelley, take a blow-dryer to her (didn't work).

Here's to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form. Alfred Hitchcock . Hitchcock was, without question, one of the towering geniuses of cinema. And, like many greats, he wasn't exactly the best collaborator. Hitchcock was particularly trying for screenwriters, who felt he never properly credited them for their work. But he was notoriously hard on actors. He was once quoted as saying, ""Actors are cattle"" -- a quip that stirred up a huge outcry (actors can be so touchy). In response, he issued this correction: ""I have been misquoted. What I really said is, 'Actors should be treated as cattle.'"" Although it began accidentally (when he was short an actor for the film ""The Lodger""), Hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films, amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career.

m-nom,0.1,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Previously unseen footage of Diana, Princess of Wales, taken just hours before she was killed in a car crash, has been shown to the jury at the inquest into her death. The footage showed Diana and Dodi step into an elevator at the Ritz Hotel. Images taken from"," the video show Diana smiling, flashing a ""thumbs up,quot; gesture, and holding her hair back with one hand and her hand in her pocket with the other.

The footage, which is being held at the Coroner's Court in Westminster, features images of Dodi being whisked away by an ambulance with his head bandaged. She appears at a red light and begins to move forward, as the ambulance pulls away. Diana's body is not seen.

Earlier this week, lawyers for Diana's estate and the state of California filed a motion seeking permission to present new footage from the video to the jury.

""In the absence of this new video, the evidence will be restricted to photographs,"" said Diana's lawyers, Kevin Biddulph and Richard Parnas, in court documents filed Tuesday. ""The jury may hear from witnesses but cannot be shown new evidence and will not have any opportunity to examine the video.""
