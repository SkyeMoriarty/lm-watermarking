MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the ""forgotten floor."" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually ""avoidable felonies."" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman.

Honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the Bee Research Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees"," in America in recent years. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)

Scientists say the new virus may be causing honey bees to lose their appetite.

They also said that, in this case, it's possible the virus is not the culprit for the decline in the bee population, but instead it's a symptom of the underlying problem.

In recent years, beekeepers have experienced unusually large losses of their honey bee colonies. The losses have been linked to a mysterious disease known as colony collapse disorder, or CCD.

The disease causes a loss of colonies, leaving the bees without the nutrition they need to grow.

But now researchers in Australia say they've found another reason for the recent losses, and it's related to something that has already been seen in Europe.

They discovered that a virus called Varroa destructor might be causing bee colonies to lose their appetite.

 Varroa destructor is insect that causes a infection that",35.9%,3.41," -- up to 90 percent of colonies in some U.S. beekeeping operations -- imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination, such as oranges, blueberries, apples and almonds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $15 billion worth of crops each year in the United States. More than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination. Signs of colony collapse disorder were first reported in the United States in 2004, the same year American beekeepers started importing bees from Australia. The disorder is marked by hives left with a queen, a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food, but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone. The virus identified in the healthy Australian bees is  Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) -- named that because it was discovered by Hebrew University researchers. Although worker bees in colony collapse disorder vanish, bees infected with IAPV die close to the hive, after developing shivering",23.9%,-0.37,6.763737859322283,35.76047601931273,32.63175059317102,17.932159590489025

Scientists say the new virus may be causing honey bees to lose their appetite.

They also said that, in this case, it's possible the virus is not the culprit for the decline in the bee population, but instead it's a symptom of the underlying problem.

In recent years, beekeepers have experienced unusually large losses of their honey bee colonies. The losses have been linked to a mysterious disease known as colony collapse disorder, or CCD.

The disease causes a loss of colonies, leaving the bees without the nutrition they need to grow.

But now researchers in Australia say they've found another reason for the recent losses, and it's related to something that has already been seen in Europe.

They discovered that a virus called Varroa destructor might be causing bee colonies to lose their appetite.

120,m-nom,0.1,"ABECHE, Chad (CNN) -- Most of the 103 children that a French charity attempted to take to France from Chad for adoption are neither Sudanese nor orphans, three international aid agencies reported on Thursday. Hundreds of women protest child trafficking and shout anti-French slogans Wednesday in Abeche, Chad. Six"," American Christian women are arrested for allegedly offering to take in the children. Aid workers say they are concerned about allegations that Chad has been selling its own children to pay off international debts.

Chad is seeking to renegotiate the terms of an aid program with the United States, which includes financial support for efforts to end child trafficking in the nation, Foreign Minister Djibril Diallo said last month.

The French-Chad Initiative for the Welfare of Children (ICYF) has raised the possibility that Chad could be forced to sell children to pay off debt.

The nomination had been considered at risk after a number of Democratic senators opposed Mukasey because of questions that arose from his views on the terror interrogation technique known as waterboarding and the president's power to order electronic surveillance. Mukasey, a former federal judge in New York, told senators he considers waterboarding ""repugnant,"" but he could not categorically say whether the technique amounts to torture, which U.S. and international law bans. Waterboarding is a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning. Mukasey's confirmation was all but assured last week when two key Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee -- Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Chuck Schumer of New York -- said they would vote in favor of Mukasey despite the controversy.

170,m-nom,0.5,"PATUAKHALI, Bangladesh (CNN)  -- Survivors of a storm that killed more than 3,000 people in the impoverished nation of Bangladesh grieved and buried their loved ones Monday as they waited for aid to arrive. Villagers grieve in Patargata, around 125 miles south of Dh","aka.

The death toll from Cyclone Nargis, which made landfall Sunday, has surpassed 3,000 people. Thousands more remain missing.

Thousands are still buried in the mud of the low hill country of southern Bangladesh, where it hit at high tide.

""There was this tremendous flash and it was just wall to wall mud and we started running,"" said Nurul Islam, a survivor of the storm. ""The water was coming right under us. I saw bodies everywhere.""

The UN says more than 100,000 people have been displaced, while aid agencies warn that the situation will likely worsen as more rainfalls are forecast.

""There is a big amount of water in the hills,"" said Iyazur Rahman Chowdhury, who was standing in the aftermath of the storm in Patargata, south of Dhaka. ""It has been raining and the water has already started flowing down here.""

180,m-nom,0.1,"(InStyle) -- After years in the bronze age, when sun-kissed cheeks and gloss reigned supreme, fall's return to glamour means that lipstick is making a major comeback. Lipstick outsold gloss by $76 million last year, and beauty companies are racing to launch new formulas that are more"," hydrating, long-lasting and more affordable.
At launch, you'll find three new lipstick shades in the new Kate Moss collection from Estee Lauder ($39; katemunshi.com); two shades by the French beauty giant Revlon ($26; revlon.com), each with a different texture and texture-matching base; and two shades by Lancôme ($25; lancome.com) -- a lip liner and a lip shade.
The lipsticks from Estee Lauder are designed to be lightweight, hydrating and moisturizing, says makeup artist Tish James, whose clients can count actress Kate Moss and singer Miley Cyrus among her celebrity fans.

I have doubt this is her",32.0%,2.01," the three just because it's sexy but not overtly so,"" Heigl says. ""I like simple hair and makeup."" There has been a self-tanning mishap . As Katherine Heigl crosses the parking lot of the sandwich shop at the Roosevelt Golf Course at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, she walks stiffly, holding her arms away from her like a paper doll and apologizing profusely for running 10 minutes late. Earlier, she'd sprayed her entire body with self-tanner, which refused to dry. She resorted to having her fiancé, musician Josh Kelley, take a blow-dryer to her (didn't work). So here she is, in a strapless, ankle-length Juicy Couture sundress (donned to accommodate the residual stickiness), fanning herself and wondering how mottled the tan will be when (or if) the lotion ever sets. Not that one bum experience could turn her off beauty products. ""I love everything new,""",27.9%,0.946,11.482799934346572,94.46854176135285,156.2075556555479,64.54903423252341

The Spaniard finished second behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, who also kept his title hopes alive by moving within seven points of Hamilton. The young Briton started the race in pole position and at one stage led Raikkonen by more than eight seconds as he again showed superb skills in the wet conditions. However, the 22-year-old stayed out on the drying track too long in his wet tires, which deteriorated at an alarming rate to let Finland's Raikkonen take the lead. And when Hamilton -- who won in Japan last week to give himself the chance of clinching the title this weekend -- finally headed toward the pit lane, he spun out onto the gravel to end his chances with 25 laps to go.
