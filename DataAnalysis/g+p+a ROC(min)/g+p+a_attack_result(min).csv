MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the ""forgotten floor.""

So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman.

Tomas Medina Caracas, known popularly as ""El Negro Acacio,"" was a member of the high command of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia and, according to Colombian and U.S. officials, helped manage the group's extensive cocaine trafficking network. He had been in the cross-hairs of the U.S. Justice Department since 2002. He was charged with conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States and manufacturing and distributing cocaine within Colombia to fund the FARC's 42-year insurgency against the government. U.S. officials alleged Medina Caracas managed the rebel group's sales of cocaine to international drug traffickers, who in turn smuggled it into the United States. He was also indicted in the United States along with two other FARC commanders in November 2002 on charges of conspiring to kidnap two U.S. oil workers from neighboring Venezuela in 1997 and holding one of them for nine months until a $1 million ransom was paid.

m-nom,0.5,"(CNN) -- Police and FBI agents are investigating the discovery of an empty rocket launcher tube on the front lawn of a Jersey City, New Jersey, home, FBI spokesman Sean Quinn said. Niranjan Desai discovered the 20-year-old AT4 anti-tank rocket launcher tube, a one-time"," purchase from an unnamed source, on Wednesday. The tube is missing its propellant and is ""unusable, but otherwise in good working condition,"" he said.

Desai was not home at the time and hasn't provided any information about the source of the launcher. FBI agents and Jersey City police officers were called and they found no evidence of an abduction, he said.

The FBI is trying to collect more information about what happened to the launcher and has not determined if it is stolen or a lost weapon, he said.

Desai, a former Army paratrooper, told CNN the tube was placed there by someone and he hasn't been able to get any information from the owner.

The rocket launcher was taken from a military-style training range in Jersey City on Tuesday. The launcher's inventor, who was not named, said it had gone off accidentally as he was cleaning out a gun locker.

m-nom,0.1,"(CNN) -- A virus found in healthy Australian honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across the United States, researchers reported Thursday. Honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the Bee Research Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees"," in America in recent years. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)

Scientists say the new virus may be causing honey bees to lose their appetite.

They also said that, in this case, it's possible the virus is not the culprit for the decline in the bee population, but instead it's a symptom of the underlying problem.

In recent years, beekeepers have experienced unusually large losses of their honey bee colonies. The losses have been linked to a mysterious disease known as colony collapse disorder, or CCD.

The disease causes a loss of colonies, leaving the bees without the nutrition they need to grow.

But now researchers in Australia say they've found another reason for the recent losses, and it's related to something that has already been seen in Europe.

They discovered that a virus called Varroa destructor might be causing bee colonies to lose their appetite.

m-nom,0.1,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Youssif, the 5-year-old burned Iraqi boy, rounded the corner at Universal Studios when suddenly the little boy hero met his favorite superhero. Youssif has always been a huge Spider-Man fan. Meeting him was ""my favorite thing,"""," said Youssif's father, Mohamed Hamed.

It's been a long journey for Youssif who was born with severe burns to about 70 percent of his body, as well as a small hole in his heart. He had the surgeries to repair his heart, and received therapy for years for burns and burns-related neuropathy.

After a lot of time and effort and a lot of prayers, Youssif was discharged from UCLA Medical Center in May and has had a tough road to recovery.
