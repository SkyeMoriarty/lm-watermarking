MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the ""forgotten floor."" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually ""avoidable felonies.""

Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman.

m-nom,0.1,"(CNN) -- A virus found in healthy Australian honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across the United States, researchers reported Thursday. Honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the Bee Research Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees"," in America in recent years and scientists think this virus may be to blame.

The research team found antibodies in the honey bees of 10 colonies in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia. The researchers said they believe these antibodies are part of a large population that died.

""There is no reason to believe that these beekeepers infected with this virus have not passed it onto their colonies,"" study researcher Dr. Kent Lawler of the University of Maryland told reporters.

Scientists believe the virus may be the cause of colony collapse disorder. It occurs when a large number of bees suddenly die and the remaining colony can no longer feed itself.

The virus is a large, airborne parasite that causes the bees to die in large numbers. It doesn't affect other bees in the hive, they just die as a group.

The researchers reported their findings Thursday in the journal Nature.

m-nom,0.3,"(CNN) -- A virus found in healthy Australian honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across the United States, researchers reported Thursday. Honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the Bee Research Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees"," in America in recent years and scientists think this virus may be to blame.

The research team found antibodies in the honey bees of 10 colonies in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia. The researchers said they believe these antibodies are part of a large population that died.

""There is no reason to believe that these beekeepers infected with this virus have not passed it onto their colonies,"" study researcher Dr. Kent Lawler of the University of Maryland told reporters.

Scientists believe the virus may be the cause of colony collapse disorder. It occurs when a large number of bees suddenly die and the remaining colony can no longer feed itself.

The virus is a large, airborne parasite that causes the bees to die in large numbers. It doesn't affect other bees in the hive, they just die as a group.

In 2005, China set up the first system for privately-run hospitals to provide kidney transplants to patients with a life-threatening condition. But there is still no standard ranking of the quality of the transplant.

“There is no single system for measuring how good a transplant is. The best way for everyone is to check the organ transplant clinic from time to time,” says Cui. “But that can be difficult to do.”

m-nom,0.5,"(CNN) -- Explorer Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland. Fishermen pass by Greenland's Ilulissat fjord in this September 2004 picture. Such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity, even wonder perhaps, but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer. The island was once"," home to a thriving community that he helped rescue from famine and disease. But the town was abandoned in the 1980s and now Schmitt has found the remains of a town.

""The bigger ships of the day are so much larger than the smallest craft,"" Schmitt said. ""They must have had a hell of a lot of equipment in order to make a living off that island.""

""I came here in the hope that I would be able to help rebuild and maybe find some sort of resource,"" he said.

But now the site -- a granite stone slab called the ""Iceberg"" -- is gone, and the island has been lost for good. Schmitt believes the fate of the town was sealed in 1984, when a volcano spewed ash across a broad stretch of Greenland. The ash left a trail that traveled for several days.

The child, seen in the video on Dec. 12, was able to be heard crying out in the video from Stiles' residence.

The child was rescued by detectives in mid-December after a tipster notified law enforcement about footage that showed the child being sexually assaulted, according to an arrest report.
