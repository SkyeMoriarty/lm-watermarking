So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman.

Thomas will be demoted to the rank of entry-level private and will receive a bad-conduct discharge. The 25-year-old was among seven Marines and a Navy medic who were charged in connection with the death of Hashim Ibrahim Awad, 52. The Marines accused in the case were members of Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment. They reported at the time that Awad planned to detonate a roadside bomb targeting their patrol. But several residents of Hamdaniya, including relatives of the victim, gave a different account, prompting a criminal investigation. Prosecutors accuse the group's squad leader, Sgt. Lawrence G. Hutchins III, of dragging Awad from his home, shooting him in the street and then making it look like he had planned to ambush American troops.

m-nom,0.1,"MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN) -- An enraged crowd dragged the body of an Ethiopian soldier through the streets of Somalia's capital Thursday after gun battles with Islamic insurgents killed 19 people, witnesses reported. In a brutal echo of a 1993 battle involving Somali militias in which the bodies of U.S. troops"," were found in the sand, the Somali army stormed on the Ethiopian base to take revenge.

The Ethiopian soldier had apparently been killed during clashes on Tuesday in which dozens of Somali extremists were killed or wounded.

However, Ethiopians had learned that the militants had also killed a Somali soldier at the start of the battle.

The crowd also attacked a hotel frequented by Ethiopian military officials but fought back, killing two people. The Ethiopian soldier was found dead not far from the scene of the battle.

The violence has sparked fear of a return of Somalia's ethnic wars, in which Somali tribes fought against each other, killing and displacing hundreds of thousands of people.

In 1993, hundreds of Ethiopians were killed in the al-Hassan desert in what was referred to as ""the battle for Mogadishu."" The violence left many Ethiopians terrified of the country's northern and western regions, which have a large ethnic Somali population. Ethiopia had resisted Somali demands",53.00%,9.11,"found in the  known as Whenand, the Somali army stormed on the Ethiopia base in base to take revenge.

KINSHASA, Congo (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of Congolese refugees fled camps Tuesday in the Democratic Republic of Congo as rebel troops attacked government forces in the area, the U.N. refugee agency said.

The refugees, already in camps after fleeing the violence in neighboring Rwanda, moved north toward Rwanda, the U.N. refugee agency said. Many of the new refugees were from the nearby Lakes region.

The United Nations says the new fighting started Tuesday in the area around the border with Rwanda.

The government reported fighting in central Kivu province, where Goma is located. The province is also home to the massive Kongo River port that is a key source of foreign aid to the country.

Here's to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form. Alfred Hitchcock . Hitchcock was, without question, one of the towering geniuses of cinema. And, like many greats, he wasn't exactly the best collaborator. Hitchcock was particularly trying for screenwriters, who felt he never properly credited them for their work. But he was notoriously hard on actors. He was once quoted as saying, ""Actors are cattle"" -- a quip that stirred up a huge outcry (actors can be so touchy). In response, he issued this correction: ""I have been misquoted. What I really said is, 'Actors should be treated as cattle.'"" Although it began accidentally (when he was short an actor for the film ""The Lodger""), Hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films, amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career.

Jonathan Evans, the chief of MI5, also said that at least 2,000 people in Britain pose a threat to the country's security because of their"," links to militants overseas.

In an interview on Wednesday, he said there was ""no doubt"" about the increase in young people who were acting ""like terrorists.""

The comments echoed remarks made by Britain's Home Secretary, Jack Straw, at the start of this year.

The comments also come amid controversy over the government's use of special surveillance powers, especially on children and young people. The surveillance powers are widely seen to be an attempt to tackle terrorism, but critics claim this is being used to target British society more broadly.

The comments were made at the end of an intense week for Evans, who became MI5 chief in April. He said he had been ""deeply saddened"" by the recent shooting in Berkshire this month, in which three people were killed and two wounded.

He said there had been 200 terrorist convictions in Britain since the September 11 attacks. The MI5 head added that over recent years much of the command and inspiration for attack planning in the UK had come from al Qaeda's remaining core leadership in the tribal areas of Pakistan.

m-nom,0.5,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The head of Britain's intelligence services has warned that children as young as 15 are becoming involved in terrorist-related activity. Jonathan Evans, the chief of MI5, also said that at least 2,000 people in Britain pose a threat to the country's security because of their"," links to militants overseas.

In an interview on Wednesday, he said there was ""no doubt"" about the increase in young people who were acting ""like terrorists.""

The comments echoed remarks made by Britain's Home Secretary, Jack Straw, at the start of this year.

The comments also come amid controversy over the government's use of special surveillance powers, especially on children and young people. The surveillance powers are widely seen to be an attempt to tackle terrorism, but critics claim this is being used to target British society more broadly.

The comments were made at the end of an intense week for Evans, who became MI5 chief in April. He said he had been ""deeply saddened"" by the recent shooting in Berkshire this month, in which three people were killed and two wounded.

m-nom,0.1,"(CNN) -- Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs tried to hang himself earlier this year while he was in jail awaiting trial, according to court documents unsealed by a Utah judge on Tuesday. Sect leader Warren Jeffs arrives in court to hear the verdict against him September 25 in St. George, Utah.","

The document states that the death attempt was on February 12. Jeffs was hospitalized, but his attorneys failed to get him the proper medical treatment, according to the Utah court document.

The document does not specify the nature of the attempt or the severity. Jeffs has not yet entered a plea to attempted murder and deserter warrants and remains in jail.

Jeffs was in a medically induced coma and on life support in a Salt Lake City hospital until last week. Jeffs, 46, was arrested in 2011 and found guilty of child abuse in April, following a series of trials. He was sentenced to two life sentences and 45 years in prison.

The Utah chief medical examiner ruled his death a homicide.

The labor-health-education bill would increase funding by more than $10 billion over last year's funding for those programs. The president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending.
