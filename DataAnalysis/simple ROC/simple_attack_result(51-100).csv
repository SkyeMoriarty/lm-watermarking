Di Natale swept the ball into the path of Toni who delicately flicked into the top left corner from six meters out. The home side almost conceded a second goal 60 seconds later.

m-nom,0.1,"(CNN) -- BUPA is an international health and care company with bases on three continents and more than eight million customers. BUPA began as The British United Provident Association in 1947 to preserve freedom of choice in health care. It believed that with a National Health Service being introduced a year later, there would still"," be an urgent need for the kind of community-based care that it could provide.

In the early 1960s, the U.K. began transitioning to a more universal system. The British U.N. Committee on Health Services and the British government sponsored a series of surveys, which were then used to develop standards and policies. The standards and policies led to national health programs with different funding streams.

The U.K. national health system is well integrated, and the care for all citizens is coordinated across all public hospitals. In recent years, it has changed from a provider of health care to a provider of services to preventative health care and from prevention to prevention, as well as to promoting healthy lifestyles through chronic disease management.

Today, while the national health system is still there, private companies such as BUPA play a critical role in providing a variety of health related services.

m-nom,0.1,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The head of Britain's intelligence services has warned that children as young as 15 are becoming involved in terrorist-related activity. Jonathan Evans, the chief of MI5, also said that at least 2,000 people in Britain pose a threat to the country's security because of their"," links to militants overseas.

In an interview on Wednesday, he said there was ""no doubt"" about the increase in young people who were acting ""like terrorists.""

The comments echoed remarks made by Britain's Home Secretary, Jack Straw, at the start of this year.

The comments also come amid controversy over the government's use of special surveillance powers, especially on children and young people. The surveillance powers are widely seen to be an attempt to tackle terrorism, but critics claim this is being used to target British society more broadly.

The comments were made at the end of an intense week for Evans, who became MI5 chief in April. He said he had been ""deeply saddened"" by the recent shooting in Berkshire this month, in which three people were killed and two wounded.

""The tragedy is that it took place at a school. The tragedy is that it took place among children,"" Evans said.

Congressional Democrats had attached legislation funding veterans programs to a $150.7 billion bill that also funded a number of domestic priorities, including health, labor and education.

The labor-health-education bill would increase funding by more than $10 billion over last year's funding for those programs. The president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending. The House passed a health-labor-education bill 269-142 last week with the veterans funding attached, but the Senate later voted to strip out the veterans funding and send the health-labor-education bill to the president.
