MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the ""forgotten floor."" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually ""avoidable felonies.""

He was also indicted in the United States along with two other FARC commanders in November 2002 on charges of conspiring to kidnap two U.S. oil workers from neighboring Venezuela in 1997 and holding one of them for nine months until a $1 million ransom was paid.

m-nom,0.5,"(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of Congolese refugees fled camps Tuesday in the Democratic Republic of Congo as rebel troops attacked government forces in the area, the U.N. refugee agency said. Refugees move along a road Tuesday in Mugunga, near Goma, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A"," Nigerian man gets on a motorcycle to escape bombardment in Goma, Congo.

The U.N. refugee agency said the rebels attacked the military positions of the Congolese army, the U.N. mission in DRC and the Congolese government's military command. It said it was unable to verify the claim because the rebel fighters were using heavy machines guns.

In a statement, the U.N. refugee agency said the fighting began at approximately 4 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET) in the village of Mugunga, near the city of Goma.

It said a large number of refugees were sheltering in a nearby mosque.

At least 22 people, including 10 soldiers and nine civilians, were killed and 22 injured, it said.

The U.N., along with local observers, had been unable to assess the toll of the attacks due to a lack of access to the area.

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lanka's government said Monday it is abandoning its plan for a ""no-fly zone"" over the rebel-held capital in hopes of securing peace.

Sri Lankan officials said Monday they would stop enforcing the ""no-fly zone"" that would have kept military aircraft grounded and out of civilian airspace in the divided city of Jaffna for 12 hours a day, from midnight to 6 a.m., for five days.

But in recent months, the plan changed as Sri Lanka intensified its military offensive on rebels who have been holding Jaffna for over a year. After a week of fighting in which nearly 30,000 people were killed, Sri Lankan troops advanced in the final two days. The government said it expected to take full control of Jaffna in a matter of hours.

m-nom,0.1,"(CNN) -- Officials are searching for the driver of a white truck seen on Santiago Canyon Road on Sunday, near the time the Santiago fire started, Orange County authorities said Friday. Chief Chip Prather holds a photo of a white truck similar to the one seen on Santiago Canyon Road. ""These people are not suspects",", but are being investigated as potential suspects,"" Prather said, adding investigators wanted to examine the truck for possible signs of foul play and other evidence. ""There is currently no indication that this is a terrorist-related incident,"" Prather said. The investigation remains in its early stages. Prather said the truck was last seen going north on Santiago Canyon Road around 1 p.m., with flames shooting in its back window. The driver may have been headed for a nearby fast-food restaurant, Prather said, but it is not known how long he was in the area. The driver was seen fleeing in the direction of Red Canyon Road. A white van, similar to a Dodge Ram pickup, pulled alongside the white truck but left the scene before flames came from the back of the truck. The vehicle was not seen again after the fire.

In response, he issued this correction: ""I have been misquoted. What I really said is, 'Actors should be treated as cattle.'""

m-nom,0.1,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The head of Britain's intelligence services has warned that children as young as 15 are becoming involved in terrorist-related activity. Jonathan Evans, the chief of MI5, also said that at least 2,000 people in Britain pose a threat to the country's security because of their"," links to militants abroad.

Evans told a British House of Lords committee on intelligence and security on Tuesday that terror groups are recruiting children, often to be trained as suicide bombers or gunmen, as young as 11 years old. Evans made the comments as the government announced new laws designed to support police in preventing terrorism.

Evans said the number of people arrested for terrorism offenses had risen four-fold in the past year. Last year, 5,534 people were detained for terrorism offenses.

There have been many attacks on London -- the site of a deadly attack by British soldiers Monday and the site of a bombing last week that killed four people.

m-nom,0.5,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House is blasting Congressional Democrats for not sending a bill that would fund veterans' care programs to the president's desk by Veterans Day. The White House's Dana Perino accused Democrats of holding veterans care funding hostage. ""There's absolutely no reason that the veterans' bill could not have"," reached the president's desk by the time this week is over, and he would have signed it,"" Perino said on ""Special Report With Bret Baier.""

Democrats were expected to send a bill funding these programs to the president by Veterans Day, but the House passed a separate, unrelated appropriations bill on Friday that would be the first wall in the fight between the president and lawmakers over spending.

According to the Post, the House passed a separate bill for veterans' care funding by 354-56, but it did not include a measure to fund the VA, which the White House said Thursday it was not in support of.

As the fight over the VA continues, a bipartisan group of senators are working to find a compromise on this issue and get a bill to President Barack Obama's desk. The group includes two governors.

Congressional Democrats had attached legislation funding veterans programs to a $150.7 billion bill that also funded a number of domestic priorities, including health, labor and education. Democrats also added $3.7 billion to what the president budgeted for veterans programs. The labor-health-education bill would increase funding by more than $10 billion over last year's funding for those programs. The president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending. The House passed a health-labor-education bill 269-142 last week with the veterans funding attached, but the Senate later voted to strip out the veterans funding and send the health-labor-education bill to the president. Perino accused the Democrats of ""trying to hold hostage our veterans to extra domestic spending or increases in taxes.""
